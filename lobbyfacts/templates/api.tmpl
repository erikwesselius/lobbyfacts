    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The API for LobbyFacts is made to allow easy access to up-to-date,
    structured information about registered interests, persons and other 
    organisations.</p>

    <p>It provides both entity-centric access which can be used to find
    and retrieve data about individual data items as well as a reporting
    interface which exposes pre-defined views of the data, including 
    aggregated overviews per country etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h3>Conventions</h3>
    <p>A few simple conventions apply throughout the API:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All data is accessible as JSON, no other formats are supported.</li>
      <li>JSONP is accessible by adding a <code>callback=</code> argument to
      each request</li>
      <li>Once the site is in prototype operation, all data will be updated 
      every day. Requests have cache headers, so some data may not update
      unless you cache-bust.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
